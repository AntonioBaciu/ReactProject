# Breaking Bad Cast

![](app/src/img/website-preview.png)

## Desctiption:

This project was made using React, Axios and Bootstrap.

Using **Axios**  I managed to fetch the characters from the famous series "**The Breaking Bad**"

from an **API** that you can find in the **resources** section.

The **searchbar** functionality and the **quote generator** are created using **React**.

I fetched a new free **API** containing popular quotes from the series(check **resources** section),

and created a functional **quote generator.** 

By working on this project I refreshed my memory on **Axios,** I practiced working with **React hooks**,

I discovered interesting **APIs** and with the help of **Basile**, the most patient coach on Earth, I managed to identify why an missplaced **div** can lead to frustration and depression.

## Features:

- [x]  Receive and display data from both APIs
- [x]  Searchbar filter
- [x]  Quote generator
- [x]  Loading animation
